			<h2>Who we are</h2>
			<p>Seaside.co is a summer clothing brand that was founded by two friends who had a passion for the beach and a desire to create a brand that embodied the spirit of summer.

Our ultimate goal is to become the go-to brand for summer clothing and accessories, and to help people around the world look and feel their best during the hottest months of the year.</p>
